Modules-Better way to organise our code(in bigger projects)
when using modules in script its necessary to open with live server,
else the file will not open

If theres a naming conflict, in that case we can use modules

Steps
1.Add type="module"
2.Export the variable
3.Import the variable

Benefits of modules
1.Helps us to avoi naming complex

Testing-
types :
 1.Manual Testing - check by opening the website
 Dis : * hard to test every situations (2000.5)
 * hard to retest

 2.Autoamted Testing - using code to test code 

 2 Types of test cases 
 i)Basic test cases 
 ii)Edge test cases

 Testing framework -1.create test suite 2.create tests 3.compare values
 Jasmine (popular testing framework)
 other testing frameworks are Jest(for ReactJS) ,MochaJS

Flaky Test = test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails

In the testing framework lesson 
* Manual and automated tests
* Test cases ans test suite
* Testing framework = helps us to write tests easier
* Mock and spy on methods
* Test web pages using integration tests
* Hooks

Object oriented programming -orgainzing our code into objects

tries to represent the real world

Class - helps us to generate these objects (object generator)

Constructor -run this code without calling 

1.Has to be named "constructor"
2.Shouls not return anything

Inheritence - let us reuse code between classes

method overriding,polymorphism

Polymorphism - Use a method without knowing the class

Built-in-class = provided by the language

DayJs uses this Date Class behind the scenes.
DayJs gives us a lot of extra features.

URL - Uniform Resource Locator
-- Like an address, but for the internet.
-- Helps us to locate another computer on the internet.

Promise - a function that runs immediately

resolve is a parameter  of promis that is similar to jasmine done() function

promise.all() - lets us run multiple promises at the same time
- and wait for all of them to finish

async = makes a function return a promise 

await = waits for a promise to finish
